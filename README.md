This Project Is Built Upon IOT Concept!.
#Components:
1. Arduino UNO (Blue Board on the Right)

    A microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P.
    Used for reading sensor data and controlling other components like motors and LEDs.
    Has multiple digital and analog input/output pins.
    Communicates with components via power, ground, and data pins.

2. L298N Motor Driver Module (Red Board in the Middle)

    A dual H-bridge motor driver that controls the speed and direction of DC motors.
    Receives signals from the Arduino to drive the motor.
    Can handle higher power than the Arduino alone.
    Has two output terminals for connecting motors.

3. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor (Small Blue Module on the Top)

    Measures temperature and humidity.
    Provides data to the Arduino via a digital pin.
    The sensor's built-in LED may indicate data transmission.

4. DC Motor (Small Silver Cylinder on the Left)

    Converts electrical energy into mechanical energy (rotation).
    Likely connected to the motor driver for control.
    Used here to spin a fan when activated.

5. Yellow Propeller (Fan Blade)

    Attached to the DC motor to create airflow.
    Spins when the motor is powered, likely as part of a cooling system.

6. 9V Battery (Blue Rectangular Battery at the Bottom Left)

    Provides power to the circuit.
    Likely used to supply the motor driver with enough voltage to run the motor.

7. Connecting Wires (Jumper Wires and Bare Wires)

    Used to connect components.
    Colored wires help in organizing power (red), ground (black), and signal (other colors).

8. Battery Clip with Connector (Black Connector at Bottom)

    Connects the 9V battery to the circuit.
    Supplies power to the motor driver and potentially the Arduino.
