# temperature-controlled fan
📌 Project Overview

This project is a temperature-controlled fan system using an Arduino UNO, DHT11 temperature sensor, and L298N motor driver. The fan automatically turns ON when the temperature exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 30°C) and turns OFF when it is below the threshold.

🚀 How It Works

The DHT11 sensor reads the current temperature.

The Arduino processes the temperature data.

If the temperature is above 30°C, the L298N motor driver activates the fan.

If the temperature is below 30°C, the fan turns off.

The fan provides cooling when needed.
