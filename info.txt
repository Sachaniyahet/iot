üîç Components:

    Arduino UNO (Microcontroller Board):

        The blue circuit board on the right side.
        Acts as the brain of the project, reading temperature data and controlling the motor.
        It communicates with the DHT11 sensor and L298N motor driver.

    DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor:

        The small blue sensor at the top of the image.
        Measures temperature and humidity and sends data to the Arduino.
        Has three pins: VCC (Power), GND (Ground), and Data (Signal output).

    L298N Motor Driver Module:

        The red circuit board in the center.
        Controls the DC motor based on signals from the Arduino.
        Converts low-power control signals into high-power motor signals.

    DC Motor:

        The small silver cylindrical motor on the left.
        Drives the yellow fan blade to generate airflow.
        Connected to the L298N motor driver.

    Fan Blade (Yellow Propeller):

        The four-blade yellow propeller at the top left.
        Attaches to the DC motor to create airflow when the motor runs.

    9V Battery:

        The blue battery labeled "FirstWatt" on the left.
        Provides power to the motor driver (L298N) to run the DC motor.

    Jumper Wires:

        Various red, black, yellow, and orange wires connecting components.
        Used for electrical connections between Arduino, sensors, and motor driver.

    Battery Connector (Black & Red Wires):

        Connects the 9V battery to the L298N motor driver.
        Supplies power for motor operation.

üìå Connection of Components:

    DHT11 Sensor to Arduino:

        Connect the VCC pin of the DHT11 to 5V on the Arduino.
        Connect the GND pin of the DHT11 to GND on the Arduino.
        Connect the Data pin of the DHT11 to D2 on the Arduino.

    L298N Motor Driver to Arduino:

        Connect IN1 on the L298N to D3 on the Arduino.
        Connect IN2 on the L298N to D4 on the Arduino.
        Connect the GND of the L298N to GND on the Arduino.
        Connect the 5V pin of the L298N to 5V on the Arduino.

    DC Motor to L298N:

        Connect one wire of the DC motor to OUT1 on the L298N.
        Connect the other wire of the DC motor to OUT2 on the L298N.

    Power Connections:

        Connect the positive (+) terminal of the 9V battery to the 12V input on the L298N.
        Connect the negative (-) terminal of the 9V battery to GND (common ground with the Arduino and L298N).

üí° Functionality Summary:

    The DHT11 sensor measures temperature.
    The Arduino UNO processes the temperature data.
    If the temperature is high, the L298N motor driver turns on the DC motor.
    The fan blade spins, providing airflow.
    Power is supplied by the 9V battery.
